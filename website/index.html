    <h1 id = "for" >Batty Mcrae? No it's </h1>
    <h1 id="title">!!!!!Matty McRae!!!!!</h1>
    <p > His favorite artist you might ask? take a guess........ ITS TATE MCRAE.
        Matty was born with a love for Tate McRae, and she didnt even realese a song yet!
        The year 2016 was the year his life changed when Tate realesed her first song! His one goal since then was to meet this person who he called his icon. 
        Every album she realesed, he would be the first listener. He never was a night owl, except for those nights of Tate McRae's album drops.
        He loves Tate Mcrae with a passion, but feels the need to hide it from his fellow teachers, and their students.
        Conflictingly he loves singing her songs and has a great time while. He's been so sad since her last album drop, becuase he wants more songs.
        Give it up for MATTY MCRAE!! <button type="button" onclick="handleSubmit()">press me!</button>
